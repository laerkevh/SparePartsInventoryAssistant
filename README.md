# Spare Parts Inventory Assistant

This Week 3 assignment was about creating a simple text-based assistant
that helps a user check whether a spare part is available in the
inventory. The program keeps asking the user which part they need until
a valid part is entered.

The inventory contains three parts:

- hydraulic pump  
- PLC module  
- servo motor  

The assistant:

- greets the user,
- repeatedly asks which part they need,
- checks if the input matches one of the known parts,
- prints a positive message if the part exists and then exits,
- prints a negative message if the part does not exist,
- handles two special questions by listing all available parts.

The program uses a `while` loop, string comparison, and simple console I/O.
